# SAMGovAnalytics
A series of tools to help analyze the vast market of federal contracting opportunities.

Full list of Government Services Administration (GSA) APIs can be found here: https://open.gsa.gov/api/

This repository will focus only on SAM.Gov APIs to automate opportunity management for federal contractors.

To start, this repository will cover:
1. Public Opportunities API: https://open.gsa.gov/api/get-opportunities-public-api/ -- This gives data on oppoetunities.
2. Opportunity Management API: https://open.gsa.gov/api/opportunities-api/ -- This gives the ability to submit opportunity responses.
